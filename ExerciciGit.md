## Steps Followed

1. **Create a GitHub Account:**


2. **Create a New Repository:**
   - Log in to GitHub.
   - Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository."
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., "Exercise1") and add a brief description.
   - Optionally, initialize this repository with a README.
   - Click "Create repository."

3. **Clone the Repository Locally:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

    
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Exercise1.git
    

4. **Create a New File:**
   - Change into the newly created directory:

    
     cd Exercise1
     

   - Create a new file named `E1Github.md` using a text editor or the following command:

     
     touch E1Github.md
     

5. **Document the Process in ExrciciGit.md:**
   - Open `E1Github.md` in a text editor and document the process, including the Git commands. For example:


     1. Created a new repository on GitHub named "Exercise1."
     2. Cloned the repository to my local machine:

     
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/Exercise1.git
     

     3. Created a new file `ExerciciGit.md`:

    
     touch ExerciciGit
 

6. **Commit and Push Changes:**

     git add ExerciciGit.md
     

   - Commit the changes:

     
     git commit -m "Added ExerciciGit.md documenting the GitHub setup process"
     

   - Push the changes to GitHub:

    
     git push origin master
